-> Re-implement text rendering, possibly with FreeType
	- https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering
- Re-implement audio rendering
- (Re?) implemement testing harness


-> Improve and optimize text rendering
	-> use an array instead of a map for ascii
	-> render unicode and emoji

Done:

-> Move over Texture class
-> Move over all the render context functions
-> internal shader

Issues:
